              <h2>Venus is the second planet from the Sun</h2>
                <p>As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky 
                after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible 
                to the naked eye in broad daylight.[18][19] Venus's orbit 
                is smaller than that of Earth, but its maximal elongation 
                is 47°; thus, at latitudes with a day-night cycle, it is 
                most readily visible for up to a few hours following the 
                start of sunset or before sunrise. At times, it has been 
                seen in a completely dark sky. Venus orbits the Sun every 
                224.7 Earth days.[20] It has a synodic day length of 117 
                Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days.
                 Consequently, it takes longer to rotate about its axis 
                 than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so 
                 in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means 
                 that the Sun rises from its western horizon and sets in 
                 its east.[21] Venus does not have any moons, a distinction 
                 it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar 
                 System.</p>

                <h2>The third smallest planet in the Solar System</h2>
                  <p>Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's
                    "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity
                    to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from
                    Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four
                    terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide.
                    The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times
                    the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m
                    (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is closer to
                    the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar
                    System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is
                    shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric
                    acid, preventing its surface from being seen from Earth in light.
                    It may have had water oceans in the past,[23][24] but after these
                    evaporated the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect.[25] The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen
                    has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of 
                    the lack of a planetary magnetic field.[26] Because of the lethal 
                    surface conditions, the planet is sometimes referred to as Earth's 
                    "evil twin".
