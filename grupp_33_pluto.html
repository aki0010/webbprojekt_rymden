      <h2>FACTS</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>Pluto is one third water</p>
      <p>This is in the form of water ice which is more than 3 times as much water as in all the
        Earth’s oceans, the remaining two thirds are rock. Pluto’s surface is covered with ices, and
        has several mountain ranges, light and dark regions, and a scattering of craters.</p>
        <p>Pluto has been visited by one spacecraft</p>
      <p>The New Horizons spacecraft, which was launched in 2006, flew by Pluto on the 14th of July
        2015 and took a series of images and other measurements. New Horizons is now on its way
        to the Kuiper Belt to explore even more distant objects.</p>
        <p>Pluto is the largest dwarf planet</p>
      <p>At one point it was thought this could be Eris. Currently the most accurate measurements
        give Eris an average diameter of 2,326 km with a margin of error of 12 km, while Pluto’s
        diameter is 2,372 km with a 2 km margin of error.</p>
